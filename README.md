# GoetiaKali

Hey there! Welcome to my project, GoetiaKali, where I've combined the mystique of the 72 Goetia demons with advanced Kali Linux techniques to create a unique learning platform. If you're an ethical hacker, pen tester, or cybersecurity enthusiast like me, you're going to find this approach both engaging and enlightening.

## About

I've taken each of the 72 demons from the Goetia and mapped them to specific techniques or tools in Kali Linux. Each demon here is more than just a name; they're your guides to mastering these cybersecurity skills, making learning not just educational but also memorable and fun.

## Features

- **72 Techniques:** I've linked each demon to a Kali technique, ranging from basic network scans to complex AI in security assessments. There's a demon for every skill you want to learn.
- **Interactive CLI:** I've created a custom Bash script interface so you can easily navigate through and execute these techniques, summoning each demon at your command.
- **Educational Content:** For each technique, I've included detailed documentation on concepts, tools, and the importance of ethical usage. It's all about learning responsibly.
- **Customization:** You're not stuck with what I've provided. Feel free to tweak, expand, or even add your own techniques to the mix because learning should be personalized.
